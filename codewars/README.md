# Codewars Archive

This directory contains a curated archive of Codewars solutions organized by language and difficulty.

Layout
- codewars/<language>/<difficulty>/ — solution files and a template.
- Each solution file should include a short metadata header (Kata name, difficulty, link, date, notes).
- Empty directories are populated with a .gitkeep so Git will track them.

Guidelines
- Do not include complete test suites or proprietary problem descriptions — include only your solution and a link back to the kata.
- Use the provided template for consistency.
- If you want everything private later, you can make the entire repository private.

Example usage
- Add a new solution in `codewars/python/8kyu/` following the template.
- Keep commit messages grouped (e.g., "Add 20 python 8kyu solutions").
